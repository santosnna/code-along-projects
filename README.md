### Building Angular and Node Apps with Authentication

This is a message board web application with both front-end and back-end components. The system displays messages registered in the application, which can be filtered by name, and has a function for posting new messages that are updated in real time sending notifications for success or failure. It allows for user registration with appropriate form validation and login/logout of existing accounts.
